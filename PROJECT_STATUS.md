## 📞 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Server won't start**: Check MongoDB is running
2. **CORS errors**: Verify backend CORS configuration
3. **Authentication fails**: Check JWT_SECRET in .env
4. **Database connection**: Verify MONGO_URI in .env

### Environment Variables Required
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/communityDB
